# LD-Nativity

A nativity scene minigame using three.js and the LDraw™-Library...

---

## Try it online

[You can try the game online here.](https://github.com/mamueso/ld-nativity-xr/nscene.html)

---

## System requirements

The minigame should run on all modern PCs or laptops, however a dedicated graphics card is recommended.

Online version tested with Chromium and Firefox, but you can try others with WebGL support too.

Gamepad support tested with Chrome(-ium).

Mobile devices are somewhat supported, Chrome for Android and Safari tested, keep the graphics settings low.

## Starting for developers

run ```npm install```
> this will also download the needed LDraw™ files, but this may take a rather long time
>
> I recommend unpacking the contents of the [complete LDraw™ library](http://www.ldraw.org/library/updates/complete.zip) into the ```ldraw``` folder first

then run ```npm run serve``` for a browser version - start a browser at ```http://localhost:8080/nscene.html```

or run ```npm run start``` or ```electron .``` for a standalone application using electron.

Have fun :)
