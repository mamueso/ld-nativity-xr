A nativity scene minigame using three.js and the LDraw™-Library...

---

## Try it online

[You can try the game online here.](https://goeroeg.github.io/ld-nativity/nscene.html)

---

## System requirements

The minigame should run on all modern PCs or laptops, however a dedicated graphics card is recommended.

Mobile devices are not supported yet.

Online version tested with Chromium and Firefox, but you can try others with WebGL support too.

Gamepad support tested with Chrome(-ium).

---

## Starting for developers

run ```npm install```
> this will also download the needed LDraw™ files, but this may take a rather long time
>
> I recommend unpacking the contents of the [complete LDraw™ library](http://www.ldraw.org/library/updates/complete.zip) into the ```ldraw``` folder first

then run ```npm run serve``` for a browser version - start a browser at ```http://localhost:8080/nscene.html```

or run ```npm run start``` or ```electron .``` for a standalone application using electron.

Have fun :)
